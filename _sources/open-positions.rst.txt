The Institute for Metallic Materials (Prof. K. Nielsch) of the IFW Dresden offers a PhD position (m/f/d) within the Magnetic Materials Group (Dr. Thomas G. Woodcock) on the topic of Advanced Sustainable Permanent Magnets - Materials, Processing and Data.

Project Overview:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EU-Project: Magnetic Multiscale Modelling Suite (MaMMoS) is focussed on magnetic materials which are essential for many applications in energy, information, and communication technologies.
Complex phenomena occurring at different length and time scales often limit the development of new magnetic materials and devices.
The goal of this project is to develop a magnetic multiscale modelling suite that will allow the design and optimisation of magnetic materials and devices based on multiscale modelling, characterisation, and numerical optimisation (further information: `here <https://mammos-project.github.io/index.html>`_).
The role of IFW Dresden in this project is to synthesise, processes and characterise a range of novel magnetic materials, particularly permanent magnets, and to provide the resulting data to the partners developing the modelling suite.
Modern techniques in research data management will be applied in order to ensure the useability of the data.

In pursuit of this research, we are inviting one PhD student (m/f/d) to join our interdisciplinary team.
The successful candidate (m/f/d) will receive comprehensive training in the synthesis, processing and characterisation of permanent magnets.
Important techniques will include melting, heat treatments, powder metallurgy, magnetic measurements, X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy.
Their primary responsibility will be to produce high-quality and timely scientific results aligned with our research project objectives. Additionally, they will disseminate their findings through publications in high-impact scientific journals and presentations at relevant conferences.
Their contributions will be pivotal in advancing next-generation magnetic materials.

Profile:
~~~~~~~~

We welcome applications from individuals with a Master's degree in Materials Science.
Prior experience in the processing and characterisation of permanent magnets, particularly concerning recycling processes and recycled magnets, is essential.
We seek candidates (m/f/d) with a passion for cutting-edge research, excellent communication skills, and the ability to work effectively in a team.
Strong language skills in English at level C are essential and intermediate skills in German (ideally at level B) are an advantage.

What we offer:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The selected candidate (m/f/d) will receive a salary following TV-L rules (E13, 70%).
The initial appointment is for one year, with the possibility of an extension for an additional two years based on performance.
The anticipated start date is January 6th, 2025.

In line with our commitment to diversity, we encourage qualified persons of all gender to apply, as we aim to increase representation in the field of science.
Additionally, applicants (m/f/d) with disabilities will receive preferential consideration if they meet the requisite qualifications.
Promising candidates will be invited for an interview.

Please send your application with informative documents (letter of motivation, CV, relevant transcripts, training certificates, and contact details for at least two professional references) exclusively in electronic form and in a PDF file (other formats will not be considered), citing the reference number 069-24-2104, no later than 19.11.2024 to ``bewerbung@ifw-dresden.de``.

If you have further questions about the position please contact Dr. Thomas G. Woodcock (``t.woodcock@ifw-dresden.de``).
