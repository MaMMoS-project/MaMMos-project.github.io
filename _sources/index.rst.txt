What is MaMMos about?
---------------------

Magnetic materials are essential for many applications in energy, information, and communication technologies.
However, the complex phenomena at different length and time scales often limit the development of new magnetic
materials and devices. The goal of this project is to develop a magnetic multiscale modeling suite that will
allow the design and optimisation of magnetic materials and devices based on multiscale modelling,
characterisation, and numerical optimisation. 


Challenges
----------

Magnets are crucial for many of today’s technologies, from the generators in wind turbines and the motors that
power electric vehicles, which help to reduce global heating, to computers, sensors and smartphones. Despite the
huge importance of magnets, the rare earths they contain are scarce and difficult to mine and separate, so their
production can cause serious environmental problems. In addition, 98 percent of these raw materials required in
the EU need to be imported – an aspect which causes significant economic dependencies.

Now scientists from Austria, France, Germany and Sweden are joining forces with two major technology companies
in a bid to develop more environmentally friendly magnets using sustainable materials. They are setting up an
open-source software platform, an enormously powerful tool kit of advanced modelling programs, to simulate the
behaviour of magnetic materials and tailor them to specific applications. The pioneering Magnetic Multiscale
Modelling Suite (MaMMoS) will combine experiments, simulation, and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and
design innovative magnetic materials and optimise them for cutting-edge devices and sensors.


Solutions
---------

To achieve interoperability between software and analysis tools, we will establish a domain ontology for
magnetic materials. We will collaborate with EU magnet industry to create standards for linking simulation
software for magnetic materials from first principles simulations and micromagnetics to device level simulators.
MaMMoS will use artificial intelligence (AI) to fuse modeling and characterization data. AI methods will identify
and correct systematic errors in the simulation data, enabling more accurate predictions. Moreover, AI models can
fill gaps where measurements are not available. AI models can also serve as a surrogate in multi-objective
optimisation. Optimisation will guide further experiments or simulations, reducing the development time. In
MaMMoS, we will apply this approach to speed up the development of permanent magnets with reduced critical
elements for electric machines and to optimise the layout of magnetic field sensors for high linearity range.
The MaMMoS software will be validated against benchmarks defined according to the industrial requirements for
electric machine and sensor design.


Sectors
-------

**Magnetic materials** - power generation, energy conversion, e-mobility reduction of critical raw materials

**Magnetic sensors** - consumer and industrial applications higher linear range and better integration
capabilities


Objectives
----------

**Data fusion** - Make magnetic materials data useable

**Multiscale modelling suite** - Enhance material knowledge at all length scales

**Interpretable machine learning** - Accelerate magnetic materials development

**Materials evaluation and optimization** - Design magnetic materials and devices

**European integration** - Embed MaMMoS software in EU materials platform


Impacts
-------

The multiscale magnetic materials modeling suite will make open source to enable easy access to high-end
simulation tools. Interoperability will facilitate data sharing and reuse among researchers and industries.
Interpretable machine learning will reveal insights into the physics and chemistry of magnetic materials and
guide the discovery of new materials for the European green deal.
