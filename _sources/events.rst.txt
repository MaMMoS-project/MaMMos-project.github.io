Focus group workshop on using AI for the development of *Green Materials*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can AI be used to develop novel materials which have smaller environmental impact or support the Green Transformation?
On Oct. 9, 2024, a focus group of high-level experts from research and industry met at MCL to tackle this topic in the framework of the study *Study-AI4GreenMat* (https://projekte.ffg.at/projekt/5121362).
Thomas Schrefl represented the MaMMoS project.
After a presentation of preliminary results from an extensive research and the online survey (https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/AI4GreenMat) by Jürgen Spitaler and Hans-Peter Gänser from MCL, the participants worked hard on elaborating crucial aspects such as most promising materials, AI methods and use cases, sector-wise potential and requirements in terms of infrastructure and legal boundary conditions.
The outcome of the workshop will feed into the study, which is done for the Austrian Ministry of Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK: https://www.bmk.gv.at/en.html).

`Dresdner Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften (Dresden Long Night of Science) <https://www.wissenschaftsnacht-dresden.de/programm/detailansicht/strukturen-der-zukunft-die-mechanik-der-metamaterialien-13629>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**14th June 2024:** An open evening of all scientific institutes and universities in Dresden. IFW presented an experimental stand showing demonstrators of permanent magnets. he event offered the opportunity to successful communication with many tens of visitors over a period of 5 hours.


`Science City Day Hamburg <https://www.sciencecityday.de/>`_
------------------------------------------------------------

**1st June 2024:** Each institution on the DESY campus, including MPSD, open their doors to the public to showcase research, and experiments. This year we were demonstrating the Foucault pendulum and were engaged with hundreds of adults and children on the physics behind the Foucault pendulum.


`Lange Nacht der Forschung <https://langenachtderforschung.at/>`__
------------------------------------------------------------------


**On 24. May 2024,** the `Lange Nacht der Forschung <https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/de/aktuelles/news/2024/lange-nacht-der-forschung-2024.html>`__
took place at various venues across Austria. Our research booth in Krems showcased
how micromagnetic simulations and artificial intelligence can accelerate the discovery of
eco-friendly, sustainable, and cost-effective permanent magnets. Visitors actively
participated in the research by drawing magnets with various phase distributions and
crystal structures using felt-tip pens. Our trained AI then analyzed their designs,
predicting their potential performance. Through discussions, we emphasized the importance
of magnet research for the green energy transition in the fight against climate change.
