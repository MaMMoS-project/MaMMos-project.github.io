==========


`CNRS Grenoble <https://www.cnrs.fr/en/the-cnrs>`_
--------------------------------------------------

**Information:** The French National Centre for Scientific Research is the French state research organization and
is the largest fundamental science agency in Europe. 

**Role in the Project:** The French National Centre for Scientific Research leads workpackage Multi-scale
Characterisation. CNRS will Provide experimental data for correcting systematic errors of simulations with
machine learning and for validating multiscale simulations including structural data, magnetic data and device
level performance.


`Leibnitz IFW - Dresden <https://www.ifw-dresden.de/>`_
-------------------------------------------------------

**Information:** The Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research Dresden is a non-university
research institute and a member of the Leibniz Association. It conducts materials science on a scientific basis.

**Role in the Project:** Leibnitz IFW Dresden participates in multi-scale characterization and multi-scale
modelling.


`Max-Planck-Gesellschaft <https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en>`_
-------------------------------------------------------

**Information:** The Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD) is a non-university
research institution under the auspices of the Max Planck Society (MPG). The institute primarily conducts basic
research in the field of experimental and theoretical physics and chemistry.

**Role in the Project:** The Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter leads workpackage
Software framework and development, which includes to provide the software engineering activities that are
required (i) to glue the different length scale models together, to provide a software framework that makes
standard workflows easy to execute and more complicated workflows possible, to provide robust installation
procedures and appropriate documentation. Future extensions in functionality must be possible. 


`Robert Bosch GmbH <https://www.bosch.com/>`_
---------------------------------------------

**Information:** Robert Bosch GmbH is a German multinational engineering and technology company. Bosch's core
operating areas are spread across four business sectors: mobility, consumer goods, industrial technology,
energy and building technology. 

**Role in the Project:** Robert Bosch GmbH is involved in several workpackages as Multi-scale Characterisation,
Multi-scale Modelling, Use Case Demonstration and Communication, Dissemination and Exploitation.


`Siemens AG <https://www.siemens.com/>`_
----------------------------------------

**Information:** Siemens AG is a German multinational technology group. Its business areas include automation
and digitalisation in the process and manufacturing industries, intelligent infrastructure for buildings and
decentralised energy systems, rail transport solutions as well as healthcare technology and digital healthcare
services.

**Role in the Project:** Siemens AG leads workpackage Communication, Dissemination and Exploitation. This
involves to communicate the relevance of the project and to disseminate the project results to a diversity of
audiences, in view of maximum exploitation, to address the stakeholders, to ensure the exploitation of the
results of the project and to increase awareness for the benefits of data integration and multiscale materials
modelling for the development of materials for the European Green Deal.


`University of Continuing Education Krems - Austria <https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en.html>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Information:** The University for Continuing Education Krems is an Austrian university specializing in further
education for working professionals. The Department for Integrated Sensor Systems is located in Wiener Neustadt,
Lower Austria.

**Role in the project:** The University of Continuing Education Krems is the project coordinator and involved in
all workpackages. The main tasks are Coordination and Management and Use Case Demonstration, which involves to
Integrate MaMMoS software suite in EU platforms for materials simulations, and to show use cases in an online
demonstrator,  define benchmarks, and validate MaMMoS against benchmarks.


`Uppsala Universitet <https://www.uu.se/en/>`_
----------------------------------------------

**Information:** Uppsala University is the oldest Nordic university and today a comprehensive research university
that conducts research and education at the highest level.

**Role in the Project:** Uppsala University leads workpackage Multi-scale Modelling. This includes the generation
of the most important material parameters on all relevant length scales (atomistic, micromagnetic, device scale),
which are necessary to create the multiscale modelling suite with high accuracy and predictive power.
