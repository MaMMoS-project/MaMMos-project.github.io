`Lange Nacht der Forschung <https://langenachtderforschung.at/>`__
------------------------------------------------------------------


**On 24. May 2024,** the `Lange Nacht der Forschung <https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/de/aktuelles/news/2024/lange-nacht-der-forschung-2024.html>`__
took place at various venues across Austria. Our research booth in Krems showcased
how micromagnetic simulations and artificial intelligence can accelerate the discovery of
eco-friendly, sustainable, and cost-effective permanent magnets. Visitors actively
participated in the research by drawing magnets with various phase distributions and
crystal structures using felt-tip pens. Our trained AI then analyzed their designs,
predicting their potential performance. Through discussions, we emphasized the importance
of magnet research for the green energy transition in the fight against climate change.
